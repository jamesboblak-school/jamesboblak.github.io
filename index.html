        <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
        <p>I was a recording engineer and a live sound tech by trade. I have a music recording studio in downtown Berkeley, CA where I've made dozens of local albums.  Now I've pivoted my career by completing the UCB Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.  It was challenging, and led me to make this portfolio for you to browse.  Thank you for coming!</p>
